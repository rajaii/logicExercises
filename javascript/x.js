//30 min:
//if have it good, but if lost look at hints
//50 min:
//hints if not done and testing check if on right track.
//60 min watch vid always to keep moving forward and learning
//when watching Vid:
//DO NOT code until after vid
//if don't understand something and keep getting lost ie does not click after he shows the flow, revind replay
//AFTER theroretical portion (non python coding) is done try to reporoduce
//if stuck more than 30 min of that look at answer, reproduce from that, move on and put in second "later" list to return

//==>
//  easy any, med any, hard, very hard

//learn what recursion does undeer the hood as I am getting good with using it

// redo later these could not be done quickly and without looking at the hints/videos:
//maxSumIncreasingSubsequence
//validateBST
//getNthfibonacci only the memoize section see video at 10 min

//For Ones I couldn't do alone:
//later (was able to do with theory walkthrough)
// longestPeak
//  nodeDepths
//  arrayOfProducts
//  minimumWaitingTime
//  zeroSumArray
// fournumberSum

//later (was unable to do even with theory walkthrough had to return later

//not priority but validateThreeNodes solution 2 the way they did it

//try these with hints:
// findClosestVAlueBST
// longestPeak
//  nodeDepths

//Algo Expert: try again on own:
//three number sum: finished
