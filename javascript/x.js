//====> watch video/refacotr then move on LAST DAY
//https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/

//next round neetcode
//==> redo and study on more ie. could not get optimized on own and/or took a number of tries on the brute force or optimized
//Arrays and hashing:
//https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self
//https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/

//Two pointers
//https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water
//https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

//Sliding Window:
//https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
//https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/ Look at his code and try to do the o(n)(not o(n*26)) case

//Stack
//https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack
//NOTE:  fall short a few times on ability to generate combos and permutations even on brute force so far optimizeds sln doesn't even look at that but should study this: second occurrence occured on this:
  //https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/
//https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/
//MOTE: stack was never finished got real difficult didn't do the hard will do on run 2
