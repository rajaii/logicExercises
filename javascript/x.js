//30 min:
//if have it good, but if lost look at hints
//50 min:
//hints if not done and testing check if on right track.
//60 min watch vid always to keep moving forward and learning
//when watching Vid:
//DO NOT code until after vid
//if don't understand something and keep getting lost ie does not click after he shows the flow, revind replay
//AFTER theroretical portion (non python coding) is done try to reporoduce
//if stuck more than 30 min of that look at answer, reproduce from that, move on and put in second "later" list to return

//==>
//  find-successor second sln and walkthrough, very hard string, back to sorting redo quick sort video understand code and others, revisit invertBinaryTree do it with bft building queue from scratch,  work on dft with stack (iterative)

//For Ones I couldn't do alone:
//later revisit (was able to do with theory walkthrough)
// longestPeak
//  nodeDepths
//  arrayOfProducts
//  minimumWaitingTime
//  zeroSumArray
// fournumberSum
// quickSort

//later REDO WAS STUMPED (was unable to do even with theory walkthrough had to return later
