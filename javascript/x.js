// do easy med bst, then majorityElement watch video on bit manipulation solution and implement,   watch bst construction video and impement insert, and others that didn't pass, , then a hard non bst, then easy/med bst, then haard non bst, then redo construct bst

//learn what recursion does undeer the hood as I am getting good with using it

// redo later these could not be done quickly and without looking at the hints/videos:
//maxSumIncreasingSubsequence
//validateBST

//later
// watch video and read on recursion bst traversal for:
// longestPeak
//  nodeDepths
//  arrayOfProducts
//  minimumWaitingTime
//  zeroSumArray

//not priority but validateThreeNodes solution 2 the way they did it

//try these with hints:
// findClosestVAlueBST
// longestPeak
//  nodeDepths

//Algo Expert: try again on own:
//three number sum: finished
