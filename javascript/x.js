//if have it good, but if lost look at hints
//50 min:
//hints if not done and testing check if on right track.
//60 min watch vid always to keep moving forward and learning
//always pseudo and ?'s first
//always comment
//always last proofread before clicking submit
//always refactor

//==> build queue from scratch go over the dft mthods and their visual appearance, see algy,
// assign-cookies refactor video, back to sorting redo quick sort video understand code and others, reconstruct-bst video redo, binary tree medium

//For Ones I could do with help from theory walkthrough, hints, etc revisit later if have time or also maybe understodd conceptually but couldn't bring to code:
